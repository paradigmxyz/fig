# FIG

The Frame Interface Guidelines (FIG) intends to help designers & developers create views for [Frames](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames) using best practices for usability & accessibility. It also includes a set of easy-to-use templates to help developers quickly scaffold views using primitives implemented in [frog](https://github.com/wevm/frog) which are consistent with these guidelines. To contribute or provide feedback, please reach out to [@achalvs](https://warpcast.com/achalvs) and/or the [@wevm](https://warpcast.com/wevm) team.
